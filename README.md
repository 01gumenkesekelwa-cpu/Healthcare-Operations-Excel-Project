# Healthcare Clinic Operations Analysis (Excel)
**Overview**

Long patient waiting times and missed appointments are common operational challenges in healthcare clinics. This project uses real healthcare appointment data to analyse scheduling patterns, patient attendance behaviour, and operational inefficiencies that contribute to these issues.

The analysis focuses on transforming raw appointment data into actionable insights that could help clinics improve efficiency, reduce no-shows, and enhance patient experience. 

## Why this project
Healthcare facilities often collect large volumes of data but struggle to convert it into insights that inform decision-making. The goal of this project was to use Microsoft Excel as an analytical tool to explore clinic operations and demonstrate how data can be used to support more effective scheduling and resource allocation.

## What I did
I analyzed healthcare appointment data to:
- Understand appointment scheduling patterns
- identify trends in missed appointments (no-shows)
- Explore how patient demographics and timing affect attendance
- highlight operational bottlenecks that may increase waiting times

## Tools and skills used
  - Microsoft Excel
  - Data cleaning and preparation
  - Time and date calculations
  - Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts
  - Data visualization and dashboard creation
  - Analytical thinking and insight generation

## Key Insights 
  - Missed appointments are more common when appointments are scheduled far in advance
  - Certain days experience higher appointment volumes and increased no-show rates
  - Attendance patterns vary across age groups

## Reccomendations 
Based on the analysis, clinics could:
- Reduce long scheduling gaps between bookings and appointment dates
- Focus on reminder systems of high-risk, no-show groups
- better distribute appointments across high-demand days 
 
## Dashboard 
A summary dashboard was created in Excel to highlight key trends for decision-makers visually
